    The rest is about CGI




Iterate over servers until find matching host:port (default port is 80)
WWW - choose the lcoation in server config
Route from www -> cd through the stuff until find matching directory (ofc not allow ..)
Directory -> default file
File -> return it's content / execute CGI
