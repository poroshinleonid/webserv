similar to json but with only strings and no arrays and only doublequotes

{}, ""
{
    "a": {
        "b": {
            "c": {
                "d": "e",
                "d": "g"
         }
        }
    },
    "c": "d"
}




Rules:
Spaces / tabs / newlines doesn't affect anything
Everything shoud be in surrounding {}
Every string is in double quotes
No consecutive strings (only if ':' in between)
Commas between new strings
{} for


LINK: "STR": ITEM
ITEM: "STR" | OBJ
OBJ: {LINKLIST}
LINKLIST: LINK (,LINK)*

Need improvements


_________________________________________________________________

C++ data structure:

Class Config

map: string -> Config | string -> string

Class ConfigItem that can be either Config or string

Or maybe just allow config to be a string

Or maybe make it actually be a string and write all methods by taking some info from a string (really like this idea, need to think about it more)

_________________________________________________________________

Actual parsing:

Remove all spaces/tabs/newlines
Check grammar (idk)

OBJ: {LINKLIST}
VALUE: "STR" | OBJ
LINK: "STR":VALUE
LINKLIST: LINK (,LINK)*

OBJ -> check surrounding {}, go to LINKLIST
LINKLIST -> split by commas, do all LINK
LINK: get "STR":, get VALUE
VALUE: check if "STR", else go to OBJ
